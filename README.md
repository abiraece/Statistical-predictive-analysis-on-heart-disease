Project Introduction:

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

Data Description (Heart Disease Data)

The dataset contains information about the individuals' age, gender, and several attributes affecting the heart disease in a person.

**age:** Age various from young to old

**sex:** Gender with 0 and 1

**cp:** chest pain type (4 values)

**restbps:** resting blood pressure

**chol:** serum cholestoral in mg/dl

**fbs:** fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

**restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

**maxheart:** maximum heart rate achieved

**exang:** exercise induced angina

**oldpeak:** oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

**slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

**ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

**thal:** thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

**target:** 0 = no Disease; 1 = Disease

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
